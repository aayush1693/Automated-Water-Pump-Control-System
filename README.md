This project is an IoT-based system designed for efficient water pump control, showcased at the 9th GCES IT Expo. The system leverages PHP, C++, and Dart to provide a seamless and automated solution for managing water pumps.

Features
Automated Control: Automatically manages the water pump based on predefined conditions.
IoT Integration: Connects with IoT devices to monitor and control water levels remotely.
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for manual control and monitoring.
Data Logging: Logs water usage data for analysis and optimization.
Alerts and Notifications: Sends alerts for critical conditions like low water levels or pump failures.
